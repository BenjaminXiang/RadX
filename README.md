# RadX

GPU sorting shaders dedication from vRt project.

## What to be want to do

- Optimized sorting for NVIDIA RTX GPU's (and, probably, Volta GPU's)
- Remove outdated or extra codes
- Add new experimental features without rendering backend
- In future, add support for other possible architectures (Radeon VII, Navi, Ampere)
- Add support for Intel UHD Graphics 630 (if we will have time)
- CUDA compute cabability 7.5 interporability
